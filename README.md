This was the project I completed for my A-Level Computer Science project in second year NEA, worth 20% of my qualification.
The Program and the files necessary to run it can be found within the "PGC" folder.
The PDF title "PGC Project.pdf" is the project document detailing it's inception, how I worked with the team at PGC to create a system best suited for them, and the design/development process.
